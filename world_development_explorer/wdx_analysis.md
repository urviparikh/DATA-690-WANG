# Awareness on the Impacts of Climate Change

Climate change is a phenomenon that is affecting everyone globally because we all essentially share the same environment. 


Climate change has specifically been in the spotlight for the year 2020 as the U.S. set new records for the number of wildfires in the west coast of the country. Five of California's 10 largest wildfires on record happened in the year 2020 and it has devastated over 4.2 million acres. Not to mention, 
This is also one of the reasons why the Biden administration has been petitioning for cutting down our Greenhouse Gas emissions. The administration noted that the U.S. will set a new emissions-reduction target before the Leaders' Climate Summit in April 2021. A 50% reduction by 2030 is attainable and will provide major economic and social benefit for the U.S.

### Countries to be analyzed:
1. United States
2. Canada
3. India
4. China
5. Australia

These particular countries were chosen because they not only offer a regional comparison among the U.S.-Canada and China-India, but also differ on the 
developed vs. developing country scale.



### Research questions:
1. Are developed countries causing more of an impact on climate change compared to developing countries? 

2. Is there a link between education and climate change? If a country's citizens are more educated, does that mean they are also more aware of
the drastic impacts of climate change?


Utilizing the various indicators present on the WDX website, I was able to obtain data on these research questions.

First, I was interested in looking at the levels of CO2 emissions for the overall global regions. There did not seem to be a particular trend on the global location
of these countries. As it can be seen, countries in the same global region can have drastically different CO2 emission rates.

Although the GDP per capita are not as different for U.S. and Canada, both of which are developed countries of North America, 
there is a significant rise of CO2 emissions from the U.S.(5.39M) compared to Canada(527k). Although the total population (represented by bubble size)
also plays a part in the overall CO2 emitted by a country, the U.S. should be aware of its impact on climate change. Though, it's also interesting to note that 
the population of China and India are relatively close, but China's CO2 levels are extraordinarily higher at close to 10M vs. India's levels at 2M.

These line graphs are able to track the trends of their GDP Per Capita as well as their CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2016. 

**Key Takeaways from these graphs:**
- As you can see, India and China (developing countries) have had a rather rapid increase in CO2 emssions vs. Canada and Australia (developed countries). 
- It's staggering to note that both Canada and Austrlia have managed to truly control their CO2 emissions, as they have only risen slightly over the timespan of 6 years. 
- There is also no correlation between how rich a country is and how much CO2 is emitted. Even though the U.S., Australia and Canada all have comparatively higher GDP Per Capita, it does not seem to have an impact on their CO2 levels. 

















**From this data and research, it can be concluded that:**
- There is no direct link between wealth and CO2 emissions. The initial hypothesis of growing GDP Per Capita produces higher CO2 emissions cannot be proven with the current data.
- 
 

**Future Directions:**
With as many petitions and initiatives taking place all over the globe, we can only hope that there is a downward trajectory for the CO2 emissions in the upcoming years. Specifically, for the top CO2 emitters, China and India, there are efforts being made to significantly reduce their Greenhouse gas emissions.

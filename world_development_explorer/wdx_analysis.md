# Awareness of Climate Change

Recently, there was an article on




### Countries to be analyzed:
1. United States
2. Canada
3. India
4. China
5. Australia

These particular countries were chosen because they not only offer a regional comparison among the U.S.-Canada and China-India. but also differ on the 
developed vs. developing country scale.



### Research questions:
1. Are developed countries causing more of an impact on climate change vs. developing countries? 

2. Is there a link between education and climate change?


Utilizing the various indicators present on the WDX website, I was able to obtain data on these research questions. 


First, I was interested in looking at the levels CO2 emissions for the overall global regions. There did not seem to be a particular trend on the global location
of these countries. As it can be seen, countries in the same global region can have drastically different CO2 emission rates.

Although the GDP per capita are not as different for U.S. and Canada,both of which are developed countries of North America, 
there is a significant rise of CO2 emissions from the U.S. compared to Canada.
